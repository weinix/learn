#Note:
# - This make file split the make into implicit rule and explicit rule for commands.
# - use = or := to assign values: 
#    * To retrieve the stored value: $(myvar)
#    * To make executing the value as a function: $(call myvar)
# - The minus sign (-) in front of the rm causes make to ignore any errors that occure while doing rm.
